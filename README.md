## Getting Started with Clarifai

The Clarifai API offers image and video recognition as a service. Whether you have one image or billions, you are only steps away from using artificial intelligence to recognize your visual content.

The API is built around a simple idea. You send inputs (an image or video) to the service and it returns predictions.
